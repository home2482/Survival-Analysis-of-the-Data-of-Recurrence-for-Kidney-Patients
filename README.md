# Survival-Analysis-of-the-Data-of-Recurrence-for-Kidney-Patients
## Description and Dataset
We will analyze the dataset kidrecurr.txt. , which contains 38 observations and 10 variables, described as follows: 
 
#Patient Patient number 
#time1 Time one of recurrence of infection, days 
#infect1 Indicator infection one (1=yes, 0=no) 
#time2 Time two of recurrence of infection, days 
#infect2 Indicator infection two (1=yes, 0=no) 
#age Patient’s age 
#gender Patient’s gender (1= female, 0= male) 
#gn Disease type GN (1=yes, 0=no) 
#an Disease type AN (1=yes, 0=no) 
#pkd Disease type PKD (1=yes, 0=no) 
 
The data were reported in 1991 on the recurrence times of infections of 38 kidney patients using a portable dialysis machine. For each patient, two times to recurrence of an infection at the site of insertion of the catheter placement (in days), (time1, time2), are recorded as well the event indicators (infect1, infect2) for each time. Also recorded for each patient are five covariates: age, gender, gn, an, and pkd. We will ONLY study the effects of the five covariates to time1.
